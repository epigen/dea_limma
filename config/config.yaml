##### GENERAL #####

# absolute path to annotation file, specified in config/README.md
annotation: /path/to/DataSet_dea_limma_annotation.csv

# (optional) absolute path to a feature annotation file with the first column as the used features (eg ENSEMBLE IDs) and "column" the annotated name (eg gene symbols). If not used leave empty "".
feature_annotation:
    path: /path/to/feture_annotation.csv
    column: "alternative_feature_name"

# absolute path to the result directory of the project/dataset
result_path: /path/to/DataSetResults/

# project/dataset name, used only in the report
project_name: DataSet


##### DEA #####

# specifiy the reference levels that the comparisons are based on of all variables of interest here (eg treatment: "untreated").
reference_levels:
    treatment: "UT"
    time: "0h"

##### AGGREGATION #####
# score_formula is used to calculate a score for each gene and comparison (group) that can be used downstream e.g., for ranked GSEA
# eval based score calculation -> eval(parse(text=" "))
# DEA result dataframe is called: dea_results
# available numerical columns: logFC; AveExpr; t; P.Value; adj.P.Val; B
# common/popular example: "-log10(dea_results$P.Value)*sign(dea_results$logFC)"
# if not used leave empty: ""
score_formula: "-log10(dea_results$P.Value)*sign(dea_results$logFC)"

# filters are applied to the DEA results, which contain all results, and used for downstream outputs (e.g., feature lists, LFC heatmaps).
# R code of filter: (dea_results$adj.P.Val <= adj_pval) & (abs(dea_results$logFC) >= lfc) & (dea_results$AveExpr >= ave_expr)
# minimum for absolute log2 fold change (lfc) is 0
# minumum for the average expression (ave_expr) is -Inf
filters:
    adj_pval: 0.05
    lfc: 2
    ave_expr: 0

##### VISUALIZATION #####

# parameters for volcano plots powered by EnhancedVolcano (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EnhancedVolcano.html)
volcano:
    pCutoff: 0.05
    FCcutoff: 2

# path(s) to feature lists as plain text files (.txt) with one gene per line.
# if feature_annotation is provided then the provided feature names are expected, otherwise the features from the input data frame are used.
# used to highlight features in volcano plots and generate LFC clustered heatmaps
# only use camelCase for the feature_list names like in the examples below.
# if not used: put an empty entry e.g., noGenes: ""

    interestingGenes: "path/to/interesting_genes.txt"
